[Weather app exam]
Please create a simple information web app for tourists. You can use Laravel with VueJS or OOP PHP + JavaScript framework (jQuery/ES6/ES5)

[Background]
This page aims to provide travel information of Japan for foreign tourists visiting Japan for the first time.<br />
The traveller has the possibility of going to the following cities.<br />
Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Nagoya

Why my UI & UX implementation and code are the best.<br />
	UI: Stunning visuals, very pleasent to look at, conforms for mobile use, and can still be used visually on a computer.<br />
	UX: With easy to use dropdown selections and simple button usage the user will find it very easy and relaxing to use.<br />
	Code: Using VueJS, Javascript, HTML and CSS the webpage is very responsive and reactive. The code itself is written and held within their own appropriate files to be linked/used by the html page.
	
Author Notes:
	Weather app exam - <br />
	requirement 1: Forecast data for the select 6 Japanese cities (Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Nagoya) works as intended and in a timely manner.<br />
	requirement 2: foursquare was not working/cooperating, so I opted to use geoapify instead. The geoapify API does work as intended for finding commerical locations of interst, but loads rather slowly in comparison to the rest of the system.
